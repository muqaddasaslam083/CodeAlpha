# CodeAlpha
"I'm currently interning at Code Alpha, where I've completed a task that involved developing a Hangman game in Python. This project showcases my proficiency in Python programming and my ability to implement interactive applications. The game allows users to guess letters to uncover a hidden word, with a visually represented hangman indicating incorrect guesses. This repository contains the code for the Hangman game, demonstrating my coding skills and problem-solving abilities. I welcome feedback and contributions from the community to improve the project further."
